# Testcase-on-StapleAi
# Project Description: Manual Testing on Staple AI Website
This project focuses on performing manual functional and UI testing of the Staple AI website. The objective was to verify core functionalities like form validation, navigation flow, login process, and UI alignment. The testing process included both positive and negative test cases to identify bugs and ensure the website meets usability and functionality standards.

# Key areas tested:

Form Validation: The "Book a Demo" form accepted invalid mobile numbers and email addresses without any error message, which is a critical validation bug.

Navigation Bar: All primary navigation links (Solutions, Company, Contact Us) functioned correctly and led to the expected pages.

Login Functionality: The login/sign-in module successfully blocked access with incorrect credentials, ensuring user authentication works as intended.

UI Alignment: All texts, buttons, and sections across pages were well-aligned and visually consistent.

Mandatory Fields Check: Forms could not be submitted without entering required information, indicating proper implementation of mandatory field validations.

The findings were documented using a structured test case table for easy analysis. This project demonstrates core manual testing skills including bug identification, test planning, and report creation.
